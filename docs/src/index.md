# NShapes
Simplify your geometry-related tasks with this versatile Julia package. providing tools for defining shapes of N-dimension and performing essential calculations in real-time.


!!! warning "Beware!"
    This package prioritizes **simplicity**, **ease of use**, and real-time **performance**. There may be a trade-off in terms of precision in certain geometric calculations. For use cases requiring high-precision results (e.g., scientific simulations, engineering), it's recommended to use specialized, precision-focused geometry packages.
